# Analyzing United States Traffic Accident
Individual Project - Rayna Liu

## Background and Introduction
Nowadays, with more and more cars on the road, how to reduce traffic accidents has become the focus of our society. This project will analyze and inference from the DateTime, location, weather condition, and point of interest in traffic accidents. Find out the factors that affect the frequency of traffic accidents. Look at how historical data can be analyzed to predict the period, road sections, weather conditions where accidents occur frequently, and how traffic infrastructure can be improved to reduce accidents.

## Data Source
1. United State Traffic Dataset (Feb 2016 - Jun 2020) [[Source Link]](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents) (569MB)\
*- This is a national dataset on traffic accidents in the United States. This dataset contains data on about 3.5 million U.S. instances of traffic accidents across 49 states (excluding Alaska) from February 2016 to June 2020 (only 8 cases occurring before February 2016). Each incident record details its traffic attributes, address attributes, weather attributes, point of interest attributes, and period of day attributes.*

2. County FIPS Codes Dataset **(County FIPS.xlsx)** \
*- This data set contains all the counties in the United States and its FIPS code. It for drawing county maps of the United States.*

3. County Population (2010 - 2019) **(County Population.xlsx)** \
*- This dataset contains all counties in the United States and its estimated population from 2010 to 2019. It for comparative analysis of traffic accidents and population relations in each county.*

4. Counties json file **(us-counties.json)** \
*- Open counties json file for plot United States county map*
